The Prime Minister presided over a meeting of Ministers held at No. 10 Downing Street on Thursday, the 25th April, 1940. There were present:-

The Prime Minister (in the Chair).

The Lord President of the Council.

The Secretary of State for India.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies.

The Secretary of State for Scotland.

The President of the Board of Education.

The Minister of Health.

The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.

The Minister of Food.

The Minister of Shipping.

The Minister of Information.

The Minister of Economic Warfare.

The First Commissioner of Works.

The Postmaster-General.

The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

The Secretary for Mines.

The Prime Minister said that he had made no statement in the House of Commons that week because he had no information which it might not be dangerous to make public. In this inaction he had had the approval of the Leaders of the Opposition. He thought, however, that Ministers would be all the more anxious to hear about the situation in Norway, and they would also wish to know the results of the recent meeting of the Supreme War Council.

The Council had met in Paris on Monday, April 22nd, primarily in order to discuss the distribution ...
distribution of French and British troops in Norway, about which a difference of opinion had arisen between the two staffs. A fuller meeting had been held on Tuesday, April 23rd, to consider questions of general policy and in particular the action to be taken if Germany invaded the Low Countries. He had had serious misgivings before the meeting, because he had believed that all the materials were present for a grave difference of opinion with the French. Happily, his anticipations had not been realised, and the meeting had not only been extremely cordial, but also, from our point of view, highly successful, since the French had given way on all the points over which it had been feared that a difference might arise.

At the first meeting, on Monday, April 22nd, the destination of French troops in Norway had been discussed. The C.I.G.S. had had a preliminary conversation on the subject with General Gamelin, and at the meeting of the Council Monsieur Reynaud had agreed that the French troops should be used in whatever way the British authorities required, and had only asked that, in order to simplify administrative problems, all the French contingents should eventually be kept in the same area.

At the meeting on Tuesday, April 23rd, the French Government had agreed to give the R.A.F. a free hand to bomb the Ruhr and military objectives in Germany if German troops invaded Holland or Belgium. This was an extremely satisfactory decision, since the French had recently been inclined to veto offensive action of this nature in order to avoid retaliation on French aircraft factories. The French Government had ...


 had been so accommodating that the Council&apos;s business had been completed much earlier than had been expected, and the Prime Minister had even had time to go for a drive in the Bois. Monsieur Léger, whose influence in French polities was still extremely important despite the fall of Monsieur Daladier&apos;s Government, had been delighted with the success of the meeting, which he considered the best ever held.

During his stay in Paris, the Prime Minister had had long personal talks with Monsieur Reynaud, an opportunity of which he was particularly glad since, although he felt that he knew Monsieur Daladier very well indeed, he had not previously had much chance of getting to know Monsieur Reynaud. He had found Monsieur Reynaud, who certainly improved on acquaintance, extremely agreeable and anxious to be helpful. It was also clear that Monsieur Reynaud and Monsieur Daladier were now on much better terms, and the disappointment and jealousy which had led Monsieur Daladier, after his fall, to show some hostility to his successor, had vanished. Monsieur Reynaud had assured the Prime Minister that the morale of the French people was now far better than it had been three months before.

Ministers would be anxious to know the position in Norway. It was difficult to give a really adequate account, owing to the incomplete reports which had been received. However, he was afraid that the situation was certainly not at all that the Press represented to the public. The position had changed to our disadvantage after the announcement by the B.B.C. of the Namsos. French troops, with their arms and supplies, had been landed at this port, but, for reasons...


reasons which had not yet been explained, the French Admiral had seen fit to withdraw the anti-aircraft cruiser which had been intended to support their landing. Thus, when the Germans heard from the B.B.C. News Bulletin that Namsos had been occupied, they were able to launch an attack from the air which could be met with no effective anti-aircraft resistance. In such circumstances the Germans were always very bold, and they had presumably been able to blow the French ammunition and stores to pieces. It seemed that this was the reason why the French had been unable to advance from Namsos to support our troops. Meanwhile, British forces under General Carton de Wiart, had moved rapidly from Namsos to Steinkjaer, while detachments of the expedition south of Trondheim had joined the Norwegians at Lillehammer. This progress had been unexpectedly favourable and had given rise to the hope that Trondheim would be recaptured. However, after the bombardment of Namsos, the Germans had landed men by sea at Trondheim, and had handled our forces roughly. The Germans were thus between General Carton de Wiart&apos;s troops and Namsos, but our forces had managed to extricate themselves and to retire on the French bridge-head at Namsos. The latest indiciation was that the Germans were not advancing any further on this front, but were digging themselves in. There was clearly no hope of a further British advance to the north of Trondheim, and it might be necessary to evacuate our forces. South of Trondheim the task had been easier. The arrival of British troops at Lillehammer had encouraged the Norwegians, but it had to be remembered that the Germans could send reinforcements by sea and air and that they had thus been able to accumulate a ...

  
 a considerable number of men in the south of Norway. They had advanced northwards with armoured vehicles more quickly than had been expected, and the Norwegians confronting them were in a state of exhaustion. The British troops at Lillehammer had therefore been obliged to fall back and were still retiring; but it was hoped that they might be able to make a stand on the railway at Dombaas. A still more serious consideration was that on the other light railway, east of Dombaas, on which the Germans would be able to send reinforcements to Trondheim, there were only Norwegian troops, who were tired out and had no equipment. The Norwegians had not even been able to blow up the railway, and the only change of forestalling the despatch of enemy reinforcements to Trondheim was to occupy the point south of Trondheim where the two railways met before the Germans could get there. The R.A.F. were harassing German occupied aerodromes and doing their best to slow up the enemy advance; but the fact had to be faced that we might have to evacuate our troops both north and south of Trondheim.

At Narvik, unified command had been established under Lord Cork. It was important to capture the town and to advance to the Swedish frontier, in order that the iron ore fields might be within easy reach of our forces in the event of a German attack on Sweden. The Germans had dug themselves in at Narvik and had fortified their position so well that the military authorities were not anxious to launch an attack. On the previous day, Lord Cork had undertaken "a reconnaissance in force" and had bombarded the German fortifications and pill-boxes. He had since reported that the results of this initiative had been unsatisfactory, largely owing to a heavy ...

  
heavy snowfall which had made the fortifications indistinguishable from the remainder of the countryside. Lord Cork considered that he could take the town as seen as the thaw came and he pointed out that this would be completed very rapidly once it began.

Accounts had recently been received of German troop concentrations in Baltic ports. Transports were said already to have sailed, but their destination was unknown. The Prime Minister doubted whether the Germans envisaged an attack on Sweden, at any rate until the Gulf of Bothnia was unfrozen and the iron ore supplies at Lules were more easily available. He had always thought it more likely that the Germans would seize the Aaland islands and he was therefore all the more anxious to establish British forces on the Swedish frontier, east of Narvik.

Rumours of an Italian attack on such varying objectives as Dalmatia, Corfu, Gibraltar, Egypt and the Balearics had been current during the last week. The Prime Minister thought that the spreading of such reports was part of the Axis plan to occupy the attention of the Allies and neutrals in the Mediterranean while the Germans took action elsewhere. But the possibility of Mussolini going to war could not be entirely excluded. It was probable that at the Brenner meeting Hitler had told Mussolini of his infallible plan for a bloodloss occupation of Norway and that Mussolini had agreed to cause a diversion in the south. However, the news of British naval successes in the North Sea had probably had a sobering effect on the Italians, and the situation had now improved. Even Monsieur Francois-Poncet, who was the most inveterate of pessimists, had telegraphed to ... 
to Monsieur Reynaud that he thought there was no longer any danger of war. It was possible that a serious setback to the Allies in Norway might still bring Mussolini into the war, but the Prime Minister thought that even this was unlikely, since the Italian army and air force were not fully prepared, the country&apos;s resources were inadequate, the people were opposed to war and the Pope was making every effort to preserve peace.

Conditions in Germany were hard to assess. In Nazi Germany the work of our Secret Service was very much more difficult than it had been during the last war, and it was necessary to rely largely on the reports of neutrals and on the censorship of letters. It seemed that there was a general feeling of depression and increasing hardship caused by insufficient supplies of food and other necessary commodities. In the south there had apparently been open expressions of discontent; but nobody seriously suggested the likelihood of a rising against the régime, and the confidence in Hitler, especially among the youth of the country, seemed to be unbroken.

Mr. Cross asked whether there were any army reconnaissance aircraft at Narvik. The Prime Minister replied that only naval aircraft could be used there in present conditions and that, although for the present no aircraft carrier was in the neighbourhood, one would be arriving shortly. There was an aerodrome near Narvik, but it would only be useable after the snow had melted.

Mr. Hudson asked whether it would be possible to evacuate the Royal Family and the Government if Trondheim fell, and pointed out that for the purpose of maintaining control over Norwegian shipping, it was most important ...


important that this should be done. The Prime Minister said that the necessary measures would be taken.

Lord Stanhope asked whether the Germans would be able to reinforce Narvik from the air if they held Trondheim, and the Prime Minister said that they would certainly be in a position to do so.

Lord De La Warr asked whether it would be possible to blow up the eastern railway line from the air. The Prime Minister replied that this was not practicable, but that men had been sent by air to a neighbouring lake, where it was hoped they would be able to land, with charges of explosive, and would be able to reach and destroy the railway. This was, however, a wild adventure and it would be wrong to base too much hope on its success.

Lord Stanhope asked whether Germany was using up her oil supplies in this campaign. The Prime Minister replied that the German forces must be using a considerable amount of oil, but that a recent investigation by the Secretary for Mines had shown that the difference in the consumption of oil in active and inactive warfare was not as great as had been expected.

Mr. Morrison asked whether the minefield in the Baltic was proving effective. The Prime Minister explained that the existence of the minefield had been announced before the mines had, in fact, been laid, and that it was not yet by any means complete. The mines were all being laid by air.

Mr. Morrison suggested that the reactions of the Soviet Government to the seisure of the Asland Islands by Germany would be unfavourable. The Prime Minister said ...
