REPORT.
OF MINISTERIAL SUB-COMMITTEE OF HOME POLICY JOMMITTESON
(A) SUGAR SUPPLIES AND CONSUMPTION
(B) THE tQAT POSITION.
1. A Ministerial Sub-Corami ttee of the Home Policy
Coiamittee was recently constituted as follows :-
Lord Pri\-y Seal (Chairman)
Secretary of State for the Colonies
Minister of Food
Secretary of State for Scotland
President of the Board of Trade
Minister of Health
Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries
M i n i s t e r of Shipping
Financial Secretary to the Treasury
to keep under continuous and close review the "broader
aspects of the problems of Food Policy. This Ministerial
Sub-Committee are assisted by an Interdepartmental Sub-
Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir H. J , Wilson and cornposed
of the Permanent Heads of the Departments concerned.
2. We decided to examine in the first instance the most
pressing and urgent aspects of the problem, namely :(
a) Sugar Supplies and Consumption
(b) The Meat Position
(c) The Cereals Position
(d) The possibilities of increasing Home Production
in 1940.
i3
* We attach hereto Reports of the Official Sub-
Committee (Appendices I and II) on Sugar Supplies and
Consumption, and the Meat Position respectively in the form
agreed by us for submission to the War Cabinet.

I (j 0
4 . Sugar Supplies and Consumption.
It will "be observed that for the reasons set out in
the Report of the Official Sub-Gommittee (Appendix I) we
recommend that the rationing of sugar should, begin on the 8th.
January, 1940 (the date on which Bacon and. Butter are to be
rationed) and that the sugar ration should, be 12 ounces per
head per week for domestic consumption, and 8 ounces for
manufacturing purposes. If this recommendation is accepted
it would not be necessary to make any announcement about
sugar rationing earlier than December 27th.
5, We have considered a suggestion that in view of the
strong expression of opinion of the Exchange Requirements
Committee that the rationing of sugar should be instituted
with the least possible delay (see paragraph 5 of Appendix I)
sugar rationing might start from an earlier date than January
Sth. We think, however, that the objections to so doing outand
weigh the advantages,/that in particularit would be politicimmediately
ally impracticable to introduce the rationing of sugar/before
Christmas, especially having regard to the Answers given
by the Minister of Rood in the House of Commons on November
28th., in which in reply to Questions by Mr. Alexander and others
he made an appeal for a period of trial of voluntary rationing.
6. We are agreed that -it would be wiser to start
with a 12 ounce domestic ration and to increase that ration to
16 ounces at a later date if found practicable than to begin
on January 8th., with a 16 ounce ration which would almost
certainly have to be reduced in a few weeks time. The
Minister of Health is anxious that the sugar ration should be
bought up to 16 ounces as soon as possible, and for this
^ason is disposed to favour the purchase of 400,000 tons of

foreign sugar as set out in column 4 of the table to
Appendix I. The other Members of the Committee favour the
restriction of the foreign purchases of sugar to 300,000
tons as set out in column 5 of the table, and in this
connection the Secretary of State for the Colonies has
drawn the special attention of the Jommittee to the serious
reactions on the Empire producers of sugar of purchasing
at an enhanced price larger quantities of foreign sugar
than are absolutely essential. The Minister of Health
has reserved his position on this point.
The Meat Position and the Rationing of meat in the
New Year.
7. Since the War Cabinet decided in October last not to
ration meat, the statistical position as from the end of
next January has deteriorated for the reasons explained in
paragraph 3 of Appendix II, i. e, (a) shortage of foodstuffs
has led to abnormal slaughtering and consequently home
supplies will be substantially less next Spring than was
anticipated. (b) Increased shipping delays; and (c) The
French requirement of 20,000 tons of frozen meat a month
has materialised.
8. With regard to (a) it is clear that the shortage of
foodstuffs has caused farmers to sell an abnormal amount of
livestock. While this has eased the immediate supply
position it will clearly result in a corresponding shortage
in the amount of livestock coming on to the market in the
Spring of 1940. The tables attached to Appendix II take
this prospective shortage into account.
(b) Shipping delays and difficulties have been
Intensified by the new enemy mining campaign, and it must
be remembered that shipping equipped with the necessary
-3refrigerating
space is highly specialised and in the not
improbable event of losses being sustained, such shipping
oannot easily be replaced.
(c) Normally Prance is not a heavy importer of frozen
meat, hut when the French Army mobilised such meat was at
once required in order inter alia to provide a mobile
reserve for the Army. So long as the French troops occupy
static positions it is possible to feed them in the
traditional French fashion, namely, by livestock driven up
and slaughtered behind the line, but circumstances may well
render this practice highly undesirable, and indeed impossible,
and for this reason a reserve of frozen meat is considered
by the French Military Authorities to be an essential
requirement. This we think in the circumstances to be a
reasonable proposition. In order to suit our convenience
the French have refrained from entering the South American
meat market as competitors with us for the purchase of meat.
They have also been prepared to deal reasonably with us in
the matter of wheat supplies.
9, In effect this French request is for the provision of
at least 10,000 tons a month of British refrigerated tonnage
so as to enable the French to lift their requirements. At
the same time it will be appreciated that if this request is
granted a reduction of 10,000 tons of imported meat per month
for civilian consumption in the United Kingdom is involved.
We consider that the shipping position should be further examined
in consultation with the French Government with a
view to seeing whether it may not be possible to make some
reduction in that Government1s requirements so far as
British refrigerated tonnage is concerned.

10, ' It should he observed that in October last the
meat ration contemplated was one of 27 ounces and that as
stated in paragraph 6 of Appendix II the supplies during
the months March, April and May, 1940, will only suffice
to provide a ration of 20 ounces per head per week as
compared with the current consumption of 40 ounces.

Our recommend a t i ons to the War Cabinet may be
summarised as follows ;
Sugar Supplies and 0onsump11on
(l) That Sugar should be rationed as from
8 t h o January, 1 9 4 0 (the date on which
Bacon and Butter are being rationed), and
that the Sugar ration should be 12 ounces
per head per week for domestic consumption,
and S ounces per head per week for manufacturing
purposes.
( 2 ) That the arrangements should be based on
the acceptance of column 5 of the Table to
Appendix I, namely, foreign purchases of
Sugar of 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons, and rations of the
amount mentioned in (l) above,
-Noteo The Minister of Health has
reserved his position in
regard to this recommendation,
(3) That i t should be noted that the decision
in (1) above need not be announced before
December 27th,
The Meat Position.and Meat Rationing
(l) That consumers should register with
retailers of meat during the week
beginning Isto January, 1 9 4 0.
( 2 ) That the scheme for the control of livestock
and home produced meat should be
brought into operation on 15tho January,
1 9 4 0 c
(3) That the question of the introduction of
Meat rationing should be further considered
when registration has been effected, and
that in the meantime the Ministry of Pood
should proceed on the basis that rationing
will in'fact he necessary early in 1 9 4 0 .
(4) That it will not be necessary to make any
announcement in regard to (l) and (3) above
until after Christmas; the decision in regard
to (2) above has already been announced without
mention, however, of any specific date.
(5) That the French tonnage requirements for the
shipment of frozen Meat should be further
examined by the Minister of Shipping in consultation
with the Minister of Foodo

12. We hope to be in a position to circulate to the
War Cabinet early next week a Report on the Cereal position,
and later in the week a Report on the question of increased
home production of foodstuffs in 1940.

SUGAR SUPPLIES AND CONSUMPTION.
Memorandum by the Official Sub-Committee.
1, The total consumption of sugar at the present time, both
domestic and for manufacture, is 1 4 8 , 0 0 0 tons per week. This is
approximately 2 0 ^ above pre-war.
The total stock which is regarded as essential in order
to permit of orderly distribution is U 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons.
The extreme minimum safety level of stocks must be
regarded as 2 5 0 / 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons, representing a bare six weeks' supply
at the present rate of consumption,
2. The attached statement shews the quantity of sugar which
would be available in this country at the beginning of each month
from December to July, on the various assumptions specified below:
WITH NO NEW FOREIGN IMPORTS.
Column 1 . At the present rate of consumption.
Minimum stocks necessary for reasonable distribution,
namely h 0 0 , 0 0 0 tons, not available after middle January.
Stocks of every description almost completely exhausted
by end of March0
Minimum safety level reached middle February.
^ ^ 2 L - 2 . With rationing from January 8 t h .

Stocks practically exhausted end May.
Minimum safety level reached end March.

ASSUMING FOREIGN IMPORTS.
ggjy^ 4-,.. Rationing 1-lb. Domestic £-lb. Manufacturing
from the 8th January. Would require to be
combined with total purchases 400,000 tons foreign
sugar to maintain reasonable working stocks in the
early months of the year, drox^ping to 240,000 tons
(below extreme minimum safety level) end June.
nn^unui 5.,, Rationing jr-lb. Domestic and £-lb. Manufacturing
would need to he combined with foreign purchases of
300,000 tons to maintain similar stocks.
g. In the above calculations no allowances have been included
for any losses by enemy action, and no provision has been made for
exports except to Eire and limited quantities to British Colonies.
Nothing is included in the figures for exports which it might be
considered desirable to make to certain neutral countries for trade
reasons or political or currency considerations.
4. The shipping tonnage required to carry the Empire Sugar
already purchased (as set out in ColSo 1,2 & 3) for which
arrangements have not yet been made amounts to 442,500 tons. In
addition tonnage will be required for the 400,000 or 300,000 tons
of foreign sugar shewn in Columns 4 & 5 respectively.
5. The statistical table accounts in column 1. for the whole
of the Empire sugar which has already been purchased with the
exception of 122,000 tons from Queensland. This 122,000 tons
is included in the 442,500 tons referred to in paragraph 4 as
being the quantity of Empire sugar already purchased for which
shipping arrangements have not yet been made.
In calculating the deficiency which will have to be made up
by the purchase of foreign sugar, it has been assumed that the
whole of the Queensland purchase will b e received in the United
kingdom later in 1940.
The allocation of arrivals of sugar between the different
Months up to and including July, 1940, as set out in the table,
has been discussed between the Ministry of Food and the Ministry
o f
Shipping, and represents agreed viev/s as to the approximate
Expectation of future arrivalso

6. The Sterling requirements for foreign currency under
Columns 4 and 5 are £1,800,000 and £3,600,000 respectively.
The Exchange Requirements Committee, after a careful examination
of the whole situation, are constrained to accept the necessity
of providing foreign Exchange for the purchase of the additional
quantity of foreign sugar required to implement the arrangement
set out in Column 5- They are concerned, however, to ensure
the avoidance of the further large demands for Exchange for sugar?
purohases that will he entailed if that arrangement is not
put into operation and they have submitted a strong
recommendation in favour of rationing of sugar from the
earliest practicable date on the scale shown in Column 5o
7. It is suggested that in order to economise foreign
exchange, and shipping tonnage, as well as to avoid the necessity
of paying an extravagant price for foreign sugar the
War Cabinet should be recommended to authorise the
rationing of Sugar on the 8th January, 1940 (the date on
which Bacon and Butter are to be rationed) and that the
sugar ration should be 12 oz. per head per week for
domestic consumption and 8 oz. for manufacturing purposes.

WAR CABINET.
HOME POLICY COMMITTEE.
MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON THE FOOD POLICY.
RATIONING OF MEAT IN THE NEW YEAR.
Ilemorandum by the Official Sub-Committee.
The decision taken last October by the War Cabinet not
o ration meat was taken in the light of the statistical position
3 then known. From estimates of hone supplies and from the
stimated arrivals of known shipments of imported meat it was
alculated that, after putting aside 30,000 tons of imported meat
nthe three months, 1 s t November, 1939* to 31st January, 1940,
wards building up a reserve (over and above a normal working stock
fapproximately 60,000 tons) sufficient meat would be available for
average weekly supply of 26 ozs. " of meat per head of the
ivilian population and for the next three months 24 ozs.s The
"ses of these figures are indicated in the attached Annex la and b.
The normal average weekly consumption pur head of meat (other than
aeon and ham) is approximately 2^ lbs, but it is known that large
actions of the population eat considerably less than this. The
ra&y position for the three months November to January was
before considered to be satisfactory, and that rationing could
;0t
reasonably have been introduced during this period on the
rounds of a serious shortage of supply.
H
These are revised figures. 29 ozs. and 24 ozs. respectively
were given in the Report of the Rationing Sub-Committee,
23rd October, 1939."

s. d £
jne War Cabinet's decision was based on a review of the supply
sition made in the middle of October, Since then three important
have occurred which necessitate a reconsideration of the
Ranges
ective supplies of meat.
pros?
(a) The shortage of feeding-stuffs has developed at a greater
rate than had then been anticipated with the result that
producers have been slaughtering their stock in excess of
normal, in anticipation of the difficulties of procuring
feeding-stuffs to maintain their stock over the winter. In
addition, it has been a particularly good season this autumn
for late grass which has led to the marketing of many beasts
which would otherwise have been sold in the New Year. Home
supplies will, therefore, almost certainly be less in the
Spring of 19^4-0 than was anticipated.
(b) Shipping delays have increased, so that the forecast of
prospective arrivals of imported meat must be reduced.
It would not be prudent to plan for the future on the
assumption that these delays will be reduced. It is possible
that they may be increased.
(c) The French Food Commission have requested that 20,000 tons
per month of frozen meat should be allocated to France
for consumption by her front line troops.
As regards (c), all negotiations for the purchase of meat
pom South America for France as well as the United Kingdom are being
onducted by the Ministry of Food so as to avoid competition for
applies which would result in a rise in price in the country of origin.
he French authorities notified the Ministry before the war that their
equirements would be 20,000 tons per month. The request that
I
C,000 tons should be allocated to the French Army has been considered
scently by the British side of the Inter-Allied Commission which
ecommended that the request should be met. The French authorities
Pe now asking that British tonnage amounting to at least 10*000 tons
pace per month should be provided for the purpose of lifting their
piuirements. This would almost certainly mean, if it were granted, a
Auction of 10,000 tons of imported meat per month for civilian
jQisunrption in the United Kingdom. As it seems probable that this loss
U have to be accepted, allowance has been made for it in
l e x
II a. and b.
The position with regard to building up a reserve of imported
also requires explanation. In the first month of the quarter
s t
lancing I November, 1939, it has been possible to put aside the
l^portionate amount of the reserve, thereby increasing

stocks of imported meat on 1st December, 1939, to some 70,000 tons.
For the quarter commencing on 1st December, 1939, it is considered
y desirable to put to reserve a further quantity of 80,000 tons,
bringing the total reserves to 150,000 tons. This reserve would be
eaual to one month's requirements of meat for all United
Kingdom purposes and is regarded by the Trade Advisers of the
Ministry as the smallest stock which would be safe to maintain as
a working reserve. The reserve required to meet a catastrophe or
a long abnormal delay in arrivals is on the hoof, i.e,, the farm
livestock dispersed throughout the United Kingdom.
v e r
6. The aggregate effect of the changes referred to in
paragraph 3 and the necessity f o r the allocation of additional
quantities to reserve in the current quarter (paragraph 5), has been
to worsen the supply position. It will be seen from Annex II that
the anticipated supplies during the three months December 1539 to
February 1940 are estimated to provide 21 ozs. per head per week.
For the following three months period the per head estimate is
19 ozs. per week, as compared with current consumption of k.0 ozs.
(vide para. 2). Neither of these estimates contains any allowance
for sinkings or other losses at sea or in ports.
7. In the case of meat, the ration will have to be expressed
in terms of value, not weight. At present prices, 20 ozs. would
be equivalent, on the average, to 1/od. But retail prices will,
almost certainly, have to be revised before meat rationing can be
introduced and the exact money equivalent of 20 ozs. cannot be
foreseen at present. The Ministry of Pood hopes to be able to
arrange for home-produced and imported meat to continue under
rationing to be sold, as at present, at different price levels,
both wholesale and retail,
The supply position cannot be regarded as satisfactory
eyond the middle of January. The facts set out in paragraphs
* ** 6, coupled with the usual heavy demand on

supplies over the Christmas period,, make it necessary for action
to be taken to safeguard future supplies.
at A period of not less than four or five weeks is required
to put rationing into force after the decision is taken.
Registration of customers with butchers should, therefore, be
proceeded with soon after Christmas. Registration of customers
v/ith butchers is necessary in any case as part of the scheme of
control of meat and livestock, which it has been decided to
introduce early in the Hew Year to implement the pledge given to
the farmers to buy their fatstock at guaranteed prices at an early
date.
10. The small butcher is a particularly strong advocate for
registration on the grounds that it will prevent the multiple
butchers (as well a.s the Co-operative Societies) from continuing
to attract his customers, as they are alleged to be doing at present,
The Meat Trade Advisers of the Ministry are also unanimously in
favour of registration of customers with retailers in advance of
the livestock control scheme being put into operation.
11. It, therefore, appears to be necessary to invite the
War Cabinet to take the following decisions as soon as possible:(
a) that consumers should register with retailers
for meat during the week beginning 1 s t January,
1940;
(b) that the scheme for the control of livestock and
home-produced meat should be brought into operation
on the 15th January, 1940; and
(c) that meat rationing should begin not later than
5 t h February, 1940.
12. It will not be necessary that any announcement as regards
decision (a) and (c) should be made until after Christmas.
Decision (b) has already been announced although the specific date,
1 5 t h January, has not yet been disclosed.
