It has been placed on the Agenda but owing to pressure of other work the ^;ar Cabinet has not yet &amp;*alt with it.The sub ject was considered by the Supreme Council of the Peace Conference at Paris on September 25th, when it was decided to accept the report of the special Commission which had been appointed to consider the subject.This report provided for the recognition by the Powers of the full and absolute sovereignty of Norway over the Archipelago of Spitsbergen subjeot to certain guarantees&apos;and stipulations in favour of other countries which had rights there.

The Commission proposed that this Treaty should be communicated, in the first instance, to the Norwegian Government which should state whether it agreed.    The other contracting parties should then be invited-to state, within a space of six weeks, whether they agreed.The Acting Secretary of Stete for Poreign Affairs has informed me that he doos not consider It will now be necessary to discuss the question at the War Cabinet.     I accordingly do not propose to place the question on the Agenda unless I am speoielly asked to do so.(signed) M.P.A.Hankey,Secretary War Cabinets2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W..16th Octcbor, 1919.

If the amount of the sums deposited in accordance with clause (3) is insuffi-cient to cover the expenses of the examination of the claims, the Commissioner will, in every case where he is of opinion that a claim should be recognised, at once state what further sum the claimant should be required to pay. This sum will be based on the amount of the land to which the claimant&apos;s title is recognised.If the sums deposited in accordance with clause (3) exceed the expenses of ,the examination, the balance will be devoted to the cost of the arbitration hereinafter provided for.9. Within three months from the date of the report referred to in clause (7) of this paragraph, the Norwegian Government shall take the necessary steps to confer upon claimants whose claims have been recognised by the Commissioner a valid title securing to them the exclusive property in the land in question, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force or to be enforced in the territories specified in Article 1 of the present Treaty, and subject to the mining regulations referred to in Article 8 of the present Treaty.In the event, however, of a further payment being required in accordance with clause (8) of this paragraph, a provisional title only will be delivered, which title will become definitive on payment by the claimant of the further sum required of him.2.Claims which for any reason the Commissioner, referred to in clause (1) of the preceding paragraph, has not recognised as valid will be settled in accordance with the following provisions : 1.
