BAGHDAD.Lieutenant-General &quot;Sir Stanley Maude has issued a proclamation at Baghdad, of which the following is the English text: &quot; To the People of BaghdadM ty,^L In the name of my King, and in the name of the peoples over whom he rules, I address you as follows :- 2. Our military operations have as their object the defeat of the enemy, and the driving of him from these- territories. In order to complete this task, I am charged with absolute and supreme control of all regions in which British troops operate ; but our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators.3. Since the days of Halaka your city and your lands have been subject to the tyranny of strangers, your palaces have fallen into ruins, your gardens have sunk in desolation, and your forefathers and yourselves have groaned in bondage. Your sons Have been carried off to wars not of your seeking, your wealth has been stripped from you by unjust nlen^and squandered in distant places.4. Since the days of Midhat, the Turks have talked of reforms, yet do not the ruins and wastes of to-day testify the vanity of those promises ?5. It is the wish not only of my King and his peoples, but it is also the wisli of the great nations with. Avliom he is in alliance, that you should prosper even as in the past, when your lands were fertile, when your ancestors gave to the world literature, science, and art, and when Baghdad city was one of the wonders of the world., 6. Between your people and the dominions - of my King there has been a close bond of interest. Eor 200 years have the merchants of Baghdad and Great Britain traded together in mutual profit and friendship. On the other hand, the Germans and Turks who have despoiled you and yours, have for 20 years made Baghdad a centre of power from&apos;which to assail the power of the British and -the Allies of the British in Persia and Arabia. Therefore the British Government cannot remain indifferent as to&quot; what takes place m your countiy now or in the future, for in duty to the interests of the British people and their Allies, the British Government cannot risk that being done in Baghdad again which has been done by the Turks and Germans during the war.
7. But you people of Baghdad, whose commercial prosperity ancl whose safety from oppression and invasion must, ever he a matter of the closest concern to the British Government, are not to understand that it is the wish of the British Government to impose upon you alien institutions. It is the hope of the British Government that the aspirations of your philosophers and writers shall be realised arid that once again the people of Baghdad shall flourish, enjoying their wealth and substance under insti-tutions which are in consonance with their sacred laws and their racial ideals. In Hejaz the Arabs have expelled the Turks and Germans who oppressed them and proclaimed the Sherif Hussein as their King, and his Lordship rules in inde-pendence and freedom, and is the ally of the nations who are fighting against the power of Turkey and Germany; so, indeed, are the noble Arabs, the Lords of Koweyt, Nejd, and Asiiv8. Many noble Arabs have perished in the cause of Arab freedom, at the hands of those alien rulers, the Turks, who oppressed them. It is the determination of the Government of Great Britain and the great Powers allied to Great Britain, that these noble Arabs shall not have suffered in vain. It is the hope and desire of the British people and the nations in alliance with them, that the Arab race may rise once more to greatness and renown among the peoples of the earth, and that it shall bind itself together to this end in unity and concord.9. 0 people of Baghdad remember that for 26 generations you have suffered under strange tyrants who have ever endeavoured to set one Arab house against another in order that they might profit by your dissensions. This policy is- abhorrent to Great Britain and her Allies, for there can be neither peace nor prosperity where there, is enmity and misgovernment. Therefore I am commanded to invite you. through your nobles and elders and representatives, to participate in the management of your civil affairs in collaboration \vith the political representatives of Great Britain who accompany the British Army, so that you may be united with your kinsmen in North, East, South, and West in realising the aspirations of your race.&quot;
