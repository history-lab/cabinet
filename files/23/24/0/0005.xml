(1). With reference to Cabinet 33 (SO)Appendix IV (1)&amp;(2)I he Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (Paper CP.-249C) and aMemorandum by the Shipping Controller (Paper CP,-2427) onthe subject of Decontrol of Coal.It was explained that power to control the coal-mining industry had bean continued under the Mining&apos; industry act for the reason that the general shortage of output andthe consequent very high world-price of coal would, in theabsence of control, have resulted either in a very highhome price or in acute shortage at home, owing to the &quot;pull&quot;of the export price.    The control of price and export neces-eitated also incidontal control of profits, wages, and thedistribution of home supplies.    All powers of control (apartfrom the Defence of the Realm Regulations) would expire onAugust 31st, and if the powers to control export and pricesceased to be exercised before that date, the power to contrcwages (apart from the Defence of the Realm Regulations) woullapse.    Since the wage settlement concluded in the autumn oflast year, there had been a substantial increase in theoutput of coal, but it had been accompanied by a sehsablona&quot;break in export prices, larger than had been experienced inany other of the staple industries of the country.    Theprice per ton hed fallen from something over 80/- to scarce40/- today, and of this latter sum wages alone took 25/r-per ton.    It was clear, therefore, that if the present con-ditions were allowed to continue, not only would the poolbe exhausted, but the Treasury would be called, upon to make up a deficit running into many millions of pounds.    three possible alternative ways of meeting the situation were:-(a) An Increase in the price of home coal:(b) A reduction in wages:(c) De-Control of the industry.In the view of the President of the Board of trade the proper course was to take immediate steps to de.--.-co id   s
the industry.    The fall in export prices had removed the sole remaining justification for the continuance of control,Seme of the inferior collieries were at present producingcoal at a loss of 50/- a ton, and it was impossible to expect the superior collieries to continue this subsidywhen their own profits were disappearing, owing to the fallin export prices,,In the course of the discussion it was stated that theimmediate effect of de-control might possibly be some risein the price of domestic coal.    On the other hand, certaingrades of coal used in industry would certainly fall in price.    It was further stated that the present .proposals would be certain to meet with very strong opposition both from coal-owners and miners;    the former because they held that they were entitled to their guarantee of nine-tenthsof their pre-war profits maintained until August 31st,the date when the Coalmines (Emergency) Act expires in theordinary course;    the latter because of the reaction of de-control on the present temporary Wages Agreement, and because,it would be alleged, de-control would prejudice the conclusion of a permanent national policy for the regu-lation of the coal trade.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the President of the. Boardof Trade -L(a) To announce at once that control overhome price and export quantities wouldbe removed on March   1st,next:(b) To introduce legislation with a viewto the de-control of profits (l;e,,gthe repeal, of the Co,a.lmines( Emergency) .&apos;;Act, on March 31st)-With regard to  (b) it was understood that sir Robert Home should be free to vary the proposed date if he found it absolute-ly necessary in the course of the negotia-tions with the coal-owners.
LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO FIRMS ON THE KING&apos;S ROLL.

(2) The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (Paper C.P.-2265) recommending that Government contracts should be limited to firms on the King&apos;s Roll, together with the following documents:-Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper C.P-2424),

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (Paper C.P.-2425),

Memorandum by the Postmaster-General (Paper C.P.-2436).

It was explained that the normal condition of qualification for the inclusion of a firm on the Roll was the employment of at least 5 per cent. of disabled men. Such percentage, however, might be reduced so far as necessary, either for a whole trade or for particular establishments, on good reasons being shown. In many cases the Ministry of Labour had agreed to so low a rate as 2½ and even 2 per cent. In the view of the Ministry of Labour the conditions under which firms were included were sufficiently elastic to make it possible for all Government contractors to conform, and, in the event of any special difficulties arising in individual cases,  adjustments could be made. The rule would not apply to small firms employing, say, less than 25 hands, who need not be on the King&apos;s Roll to enable them to tender for contracts.

It was suggested, on the other hand, that the needs of the case would be better met by making a rule that wherever the lowest tender received was from a firm not on the King&apos;s Roll, any firm on the King&apos;s Roll tendering for the contract should be definitely offered the contract at the lowest tender received.

In the view of the War Office, the exclusion from Government contracts of all firms not on the King&apos;s Roll, while naturally having the sympathy of that Department, would cause great difficulties in practice, particularly
in vies of the fact that some industries had not acceptedthe principle.After some discussion, in which emphasis was laid uponthe very powerful inducement which would be given to a firmby the knowledge that it would be given the contract at the lowest tendor o^Tftd,  the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, as froi- March 1st, where a tender for a Government contract is receivedfrom two or more fires, in the event ofthe lowest tender being received from a firm not on the King&apos;s Roll,  then,ceteris oaribus, such tender should becommunicated to that firm of the firmson the Xing&apos;s Roll making the lowesttender, and the contract should be definitely offered to such firm, on that basis:(b) That the precise for-  of the announce-ment of the above should ba agreed betweenthe Ministry of La-hour and the Treasury.PAIR WWS (?) *&apos;fith rpference to Cabinet 82 (SO), Appendix 1 (2)RESOLUTION.the Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Labour didnot desire at the present time to press his proposal con-tained in his Memorandum (Paper CP.-2264)  that Govern entcontracts should only be given to firms paying &quot;fair&quot; rates on their ordinary work as well as on Government work.The Cabinet therefore agreed that thenatter should be postponed cine die.-A-

SERVICES .Conference had before them a Memorandum by the hintstem ofI &apos; &apos;Pood regaxmilxig Ancillary Pood Services (Paper C,P.2287).,,maintenance1) Maintenance in connection with the question of theI an Organisa-    . .    t , .Ion for Moot-   of ari organisation to Carry on food services during a strike,which was referred to in the Memorandum by the Minister of food (Paper G,P, 2207).,. the Conference also had before thema Memorandum by the Chairman of the Supply and transport committee (Paper CP, 2432), showing the running costs ofthe Supply and Transport organisation during normal times,and asking that authority should be given for an additional expenditure of  5,000 per annum in order to render the nucleus Wireless Scheme complete.It was explained to the 0onferaiaoo that as regardsthe food organisation the question was not one of dealingwith Government stocks of foodstuffs, but involved the  aain-tenance of a &quot;General Staff   at headquarters, who wouldprepare end keep up to date plans for action.during on emergency, and would put there piano Into operation whenthe time came,    it was estimated that the nucleus PoodOrganisation necessary for thin purpose would cost about 85,000 per annum.      The organisation consisted- of tholocal off icere of the hini.ctry of Pood, i ,e* the DivisionalCommissioners each of whom had under him three PrincipalOfficerss    There was also tho headquarters staff, which wasthe ordinary staff of the Ministry of Food who did the workconnected with the Strike Organisation in. addition, to ordinary executive work.      The salaries of the headquarters staff were not included in the figure of  85,000, but this figure Included a sun of  38,000 for enforcement.... - Whenthe work of enforcement disappears the salaries of the headquarters staff will be-Included in the figure  85,000,It was pointed out that several questions wore involved;firstly,, should the Government maintain an organisation, for meeting strikes?    Secondly, if such an organisation were
maintained, what should its nature be? Thirdly, if the organisation involved work at present performed by officials of the Ministry of Food, to who? should those officials and the organisation be transferred when the Ministry of Food came to an end?

As regards the first question there was general agreement that the greatest danger in front of any Government in the next two years would be the danger of some great strike. It was vital, therefore, that the Government should maintain some organisation or ? such a crisis. Fears were expressed that the present organisation was not adequate, and that it would be dangerous, for instance, to proceed with the disposal of Government stores which had been retained for the purpose of ? strikes. It was explained, however, that while the organisation could not be described as perfect, it was a very valuable one and was as efficient as circumstances and political considerations would allow. Moreover, the ? Powers Act gave drastic powers to the Government,which would enable them, for instance,  to commandeor commercial vehicles, of which there were now plenty in the country. It was ? this reason that the Supply and Transport Committee had decided that the motor lorries retained ? disposal could be very largely dispensed with. 

As regards the second question, the opinion was expressed that further information should be given as to the exact functions which both the headquarters staff and the officers in the Provinces of the Ministry of Food would perform in the event of their retention as part of an organigation to maintain the food-supply of the country simply duringstrikes. ? information on this point would,  it was thought, enable the Cabinet to decide to which Department the ? Organisation should be assigned when the Ministry of Pood ceased to exist.

In this connection the ? discussed the pro-posals in the ? by the Chairman of the Supply and
Transport Obimnttteie, -(Paper CP, 2432) Per an extension of thepresent ce-rwunications system,,&apos;     It was explained that theso^sme was controlled by a GoraTru.nl cat ions Siih-Commit toe, which reported direct to the Supply and Transport Committee, andnot to a Departments      The scheme for maintaining communica-tions by aeroplanes cost nothing except during.its actual-operation^.      The plans of the scheme were, kept by the communications thib-Committee *      The wireless scheme involved the maintenance of from 60 to 70 Wireless Stations, some ofwhich were maintained by the Admiralty and the Air Ministryas part of the ordinary defences of the country?    the remainder&apos; were extra Stations not required for the ordinary defence ofthe countryj and the cost of manning twelve of these stationsas a nucleus during a time of industrial peace was  10,000per annum*      The experience of the Coal Strike had shown that,in the evnt of a breakdown of the ordinary means of communication,the present nucleus wireless scheme  could not meet thedemands which would be made upon It.      It was therefore m*xn;*ftinedthan an additional twelve Stations should be kept in being at a cost of  5,000 extra per annum, this sum to be borne onthe Vote of the War Office, since that Department alreadycarried the extra expenditure of  10,000.     Emphasis was laid on the necessity of being assured that cc-mmunica11ens wouldbe maintained in any emergency, however serious,  since no executive action could be taken by the Central Departments  iforders could not be transmitted, or reports received^The Conference agreed(a) That, for the present,  the duty of maintaining a nucleus organisation to meet strikes,should,so far as fcod-supplies were concerned, continueto rest with the Ministry of Food;(b) That the.Minister of Food should prepare andfurnish to the Cabinet a Memorandum explainingexactly what duties would remain, after the winding up of the Ministry of Food, to be performed bothby the nucleus headquarters staff and the Provincialstaff employed in working the Emergency Organisation.The. Memorandum should also give details of thestaff employed, anestimate of the expenditure involved in keeping open the central and local offices,  and shou3.d. make suggestions as to what

That, on road.pt of the HeBorundum refer-red to in (b) ,   from the Minister of Pood,the Cabinet, should be invited to consider to what Department the nucleus Food Organ-isation should be attached:(d) That authority should he- given to the communications Sub-Cormiittee of the Sunplvand Transport Committee for an additional&quot;exvwnditur   of  5,000 per annum,  to be devoted to the maintenance of twelvewireleao Stations additional to those already covered by the Viraless Scheme;the extra sun. of  5,000 to be borne on the.--.ar Office Vote,&quot;Las Palffias With reference to page S of the Memorandum by theA trr^ e-&quot;&quot; en t .&quot;Minister of Food (Paper CP.-2037),  the Conference had before their a Metro random by the President of the Board of Trade(Paper G.P.-2S93) regarding the Las Palmas Meat Works. ^It was explained that at the beginning of the War theGovernment had found itself very largely dependent on theAmerican Meat, Trust for meat supplies,    A a a result, anAgreement had been entered into between the Government andthe British and Argentine Meat Company to lease the Laa Palmasworks for the period of the   .ar and for six months after the signing of a Treaty of Peace with Germany.    This agreement had worimd very satisfactorily and had ensured supplies tothis country, at a saving of  650,000.    It had expired at theend of .1910, but since - that date the Board of Trade -had beenin negotiation for its  renewal, and, with Treasury sanction,had continued the operation of the Las Palmas works for another year,    Renewed discussions had been held with theBritish and Argentine Pleat Company, with a view to a more permanent&apos; are^Tfient, and the Company had offered a l,:--me often years, terminable by either party at the end of fiveyears on six months&apos;  notice.    The offer had been accepted,sublet to covering sanction,and a new Agreement had b^endrawn up.    The period of this Agree-ent ran from January 1,&quot;1920,  so that one    earn out- o:&quot; the nominal five years had now
e xpired.    In- view &quot;b f-the- at t trade o -p-^Ha. .Cahd n/vh. t^rnnr^athis Agreement at their last discussion,  the Board of Trade&apos;had again been in communication with the Company,-and it was now suggested that tier-Agreement should be limited to threeyears..   i,e. ,  a further two years  from January 1,/. 1-931.the opinion was expressed that a continuation of theAgreement&apos; world be only  fair to the Company, which had pe-r-formea important cervices to this  country during the War,and that it would also be most useful to the British Govern-sent.   since it would afford them an  Observation post&quot; in thecentre of the operations of the American Meat Trust.    Both-...the Committee on Imperial Meat Pas screes,  appointed, in.1917,and an Interdepartmental Oomreitfee appointed in 1919,  had reported in favour of some form of help to the British MeatCompanies operating in the Argentine,    Without such help itwas aAmogt certain that the American Meat Trust would elimin-ato the British Companies.  who would, however,  probably beable to -face, competition alone in a year or two, provided they had the support of the Brit-iish--Ooverimneiit at the present%-.1 ::.a,    The American-Meat Trust-,  it was expected, would not attempt to force the British Meat Companies to close downif they Anew that the British Government were supportingthose Companies.    It was not anticipated that any Iocs would accrue to the British Government  from the Agreement,,  and. the6pinion was expressed that the early removal of all control on the price of meat might -result in higher prices and a consequent profit.    Removal of control was inevitable, owingto the opposition of agriculturists in the United Kingdom.ahd   the Dominions and foreign countries.ThXa wouldresult In agitation against the anticipated rise in prices&quot;,and it would be useful for the Government to bo able topoint to the Las Palmas Agreement as  a definite step taken with a view to keeping- prices down.It was explained to  the Conference that there was now no long ex- any necessity for the introduction of the
-&apos;3^111..jre1jR-rred to in paragraph&apos; 12 o*f &apos;threatened^f9r^oacandu&apos;ai by thePna-gjbent of the Beard, of Trade  (Paper CP,-2393), as theBritish and Argentine Company were ore oared to orovxde tnsnecessary tonnage. *The Conference agreed  -That the President of tJms Board of trade should have authority to conclude an Agreficent for thr continuation of the lease ofthe Las Palmes Meat Works for a furthertwo years from January 1,  1921.With reference to the penultimate - paragraph of thefLd-censringof Slaughter-houses,  and   Memorandum by the Minister of Food  (Paper CP.-2287),  theRegistrationof Rebailere-^ionferenee -wars informed that while the Ministry of Healthdesired to take over the licensing of slaughterhouses,  theywere not yet in a position to cake concrete proposals-. Suchlicensing would not involve legislation.As regards registration of retailers of milk,   it was thought that the- continuance or such registration was desir-able until the Ministry of Health were able to obtain thenecessary statutory powers.    The retailers of meat weredesirous of maintaining a system of registration for-their-,selves.The Conference agreed  That the question of maintaining a systemof licensing slaughterhouses and of regis-tering retailers of meat and milk, togetherwith any other cognate- questions v should beleft to be settled by a Conference of represent-sentativss of  The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Ministry of Health,The Scottish Office./The Ministry of Pood,and any other Departments which might be concerned.Trans f e re-nc eof the Staffof the food ministry toanother De-oar tw en t.The Conference were invited to decide which Depart-ment should be responsible for the Staff of the Ministry of food after the closing down of that Department,  and theopinion, -as express--d that the Board of Trade was the most appropriate Department.    It %-as stated that the work ofthe Ministry of Food could be closed down entirely withinthe year.
he Conference agreed  That the President of the Board of Tradeand the Minister of Food should confer andreport to the Cabinet as to whether itwrouli he practicable fox&quot; the Staff of theMinistry of Pood to be transferred toth^f Board of Trade,- in order that thatPepartrr nt eight become responsible forliquidating the Ministry of Pood.

UNEMPLOYMENT GRANTS COMMITTEE. 

(1) With reference to Cabinet 74 (20)Conclusion 3 and Cabinet 77 (20) Conclusion 2a, Lord St Davids called attention to a letter which he had addressed to the Prime Minister dealing with the slow progress which was being made by his Committee in making grants to local Authorities.

Up to the present it had only been possible to allocate some £73,OOO out of the £3,000,000.

He therefore asked that the condition laid down restricting the grant to 30% of the wages bill of additional men taken on for local schemes should be altered to 60%.

The concession recently made which enabled the Committee to deal with roads other than main and arterial had not proved of much value owing to the condition attached by the Treasury that the Committee were not to assist except in cases where the schemes involved an expenditure of not less than 50% of the cost on labour. Experience showed that schemes suitable for assistance had a labour cost varying from 15% to 30%. Lord St Davids asked that the limit of 50% should therefore be removed.

The Conference adjourned the discussion until the following day so as to enable the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be consulted.

PROPOSED EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT ACT.

(3) The Minister of Labour stated that the unemployment question was becoming increasingly serious. By April 1st 300,000 ex-soldiers will exhaust their out-of-work donation and will have nothing to fall back on; 500,000 now being helped under the Unemployment Insurance Act will have exhausted their 8 weeks benefit by April 1st; of 400,000 who are on short time about one half will have run out of benefit by april 1st. In his view the most hopeful method of relieving the problem was by means of a temporary extension or amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act whereby the allowance to civilians should be raised from 15/- to 20/- and the soldiers now in receipt of out-of-work donation brought under the Act at their present rate, viz., 20/- This was in effect the original proposal put forward by the President of the Board of Trade when Minister of Labour but rejected by the Cabinet partly because of the increased contribution required from the State, and partly because when ordinary wages had fallen nearer to pro-war levels 20/ might encourage widespread malingering. Owing to the many millions involved and to the fact that cards were already in circulation it would be administratively impossible to revise the respective rates of contribution before July 3rd. The deficit would therefore have to be met either by a direct great from the Treasury or by means of the Insurance Fund which stood at about  £24,000,000 or from both sources. The sum required was variously estimated at from £11 to £15 millions. The Government Actuary was investigating the problem and his report would be circulated shortly. After July 3rd it would be possible - subject to legislation - to revise the contributions so as, it was suggested, to make the contribution of the State the same as that of the employer and the employed person respectively. This would mean an additional permanent charge on the State.
