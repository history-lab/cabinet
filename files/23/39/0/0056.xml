POSITION IN THE NEAR EAST.

5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS read to the Conference the following telegrams which had been received from Sir Horace Rumbold:- Nos. 485, 484, 485,486 and 488, and drew attention to the fact that it appeared from those telegrams, and others which had been received from General Harington, that General Harington was paying ? too much attention to the political situation, which should be left to Sir Horace Rumbold, and not paying sufficient attention to the military situation.

In answer to a question by the Prime Minister, THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR replied that no answer had yet been received from General Harington to War Office telegram No .91255. This telegram had been sent off the previous day at 3 p.m., and at the same time had been sent to the Admiralty for transmission by wireless.

General surprise was expressed that no news of the receipt of this telegram had yet been received.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF stated that this telegram, being an Operation Order, would undoubtedly be acknowledged, but since the? were many "Clear the line" messages on the wires at present the acknowledgment might be considerably delayed.

THE PRIME MINISTER then referred to the current "Daily Telegraph", which contained a wire from the "Daily Telegraph" Correspondent giving, the reply of the Angora Government to the Allied imitation. He considered this reply a disquieting one, since the Nationalists apparently demanded the immediate possession of Constantinople and also Eastern and Western Thrace.  This reply was transmitted with the reservation that it would have to be  ratified by the Grand National Assembly. This telegra? must have reached the "Daily Telegraph" by 3 a.m. He did not understand why no official news had bean received.

It was suggested that tho Turkish Nationalists would send their official reply to M. Poincaré, since the invitation had been issued from Paris, and that the "Daily Telegraph"
Correspondent had probably obtained the answer at the time it was being sent to Paris.THE SECRETARY *P STATE FOR &apos;&quot;AR then referred to a tele-gram No.  .-12, \7bich bad jnst been received by tbe Navy,from Mustanha Kemal for transmission to- General Harington.Tbis telegram   tfefii&amp;rkcd   that as the Greek Fleet had been removed from Constantinople it might be assumed that itwould not be allowed to return there;    further, it commentedon the demolitions which were being carried out for military reasons in Chahak, and projected in the neighbourhood ofthe effectConstantinople.   Tha telegram continued to        that orders had been issued to the local Turkish Commander that thetroops at Chanak should re-enter the neutral zone but shouldnot provoke any incident, and concluded by stating that if theBritish troops withdrew from the Asiatic shore Mustapha Kemalwas ready to give orders that his forces on the Straits shouldretire slightly, and that he himself would meet general harington as soon as he could after returning from Angora.It was pointed out that this t-logram.and had no connection with the one which had appeared in the&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, which was a more serious one since it-purported to be the official reply of tho Notional Assembly.THE PRIME MINISttr considered that no definite decisions could be taken until a reply had been roeoiv d from general harington with regard to telegram No .91255.   He was of opinion,from the telegrams which had been read to the Conference, thatGeneral Harington was so much concerned with the politicalsituation -  which was not rightly his - that he did notdevote sufficient attention to the military situation.   he himself was of opinion that at present no conflict had yettalien place.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS hoped thatfiring had not yet taken place.   From the telegrams whioh hadbeen received today he thought the situation was better and
that Mustapha Koiaal was- -more Reasonable,   He shoved, signsof being ready to attend a meeting&apos; at Mu&amp;Stefania, and alsothe Allied Conference, and it must be borne-in mind that though he put forward extravagant demands,  this was always the custom of the Oriental.At this point the- Conference ad j Currieduntil a reply should be received fromGeneral Harington.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,September. CO.  192S.;
The Conference agreed --

M. VENIZELOS.

(a) That the Secretary should circulate to the Ministers at the Conference the report on the interview of Sir Edward Grigg and Mr Vansittart, on the morning of September 30, 1922, with M. Venizelos.

(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for War and an Officer of the General Staff, should meet M. Venizelos on the following day and

(i) ascertain for him his appreciation of the political situation in Greece:

(ii) communicate to him the gist of the reports regarding the loss of moral of Greek troops, which had been received from the military authorities, and ascertain his opinion as to the present condition of the Greek Army and what might be expected from it in the defences of Thrace or elsewhere.

VALUE OF THE GREEK ARMY. -- General Staff Appreciation.

(c) That the Secretary of State for War should circulate to the Cabinet the General Staff appreciation on the value of the Greek Army with reference to the reports contained in General Harington&apos;s telegrams Nos. 2526 and 2524.

Mr HUGHES&apos; SPEECH TO THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT.

(d) To take note of the telegrams from tho Governor-General of Australia conveying extracts from the speech, which had been made by Mr Hughes to the Australian Parliament tho previous evening with a view to strengthening the hands of the British Government in the present crisis.

EXTRA OFFICERS FOR THE AIR FORCE.

(e) That though the Air Ministry could at present take no steps with regard to engaging tho extra Flying Officers which they would require in the event of mobilisation, they should have ready plans for the engaging of such officers as would be required.

REPLY TO M. POINCAR? PROTEST.

(f) That tho Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should prepare a reply to Lord Hardinge&apos;s telegram No. 498, of September 30, 1922, recording M. Poincaré&apos;s protest against the decision of the British Government, without consultation with the French Government, to send an ultimatum to the local Turkish Nationalist Commander at Chanak. This reply, inter alia, should recall that at the recent Conversations in Paris Lord Curzon had, on September 20th, twice notified M. Poincaré that ? /France had withdrawn her troops from Asia, and from Chanak in particular, regardless of the Allied responsibility for the defence of the neutral zones, the British Government would be free to take independent and isolated action (See British Secretary&apos;s Notes, 20th September, 1922, 11 a.m., p.3, and 4 p.m., p.2). Further, the reply should point out that the French troops had been withdrawn from tho neutral zone without previous consultation with their Allies, and that after their withdrawal the responsibility had devolved upon the British troops alone to maintain tho position at Chanak. The reply should further point out that there was no similarity with the situation on the Ruhr, referred to by  M. Poincaré.
